# Image Processing Basics

A comprehensive tutorial on fundamental image processing operations using Python libraries.

## Overview
This project demonstrates essential image processing techniques including:
- Reading image files and converting to NumPy arrays
- Image resizing
- RGB to Grayscale conversion
- Multiple library implementations (Matplotlib, PIL, OpenCV)

- ##[Live Demo](https://youtu.be/Z1-uaP81fT8)

## Libraries Used
- *Matplotlib* - Image loading and display
- *Pillow (PIL)* - Image resizing operations  
- *OpenCV (cv2)* - Advanced image processing and grayscale conversion
- *NumPy* - Array manipulation and processing

## Key Concepts

### Image as NumPy Array
- Digital images are represented as 3D NumPy arrays
- Shape format: (height, width, channels)
- RGB images: 3 channels (Red, Green, Blue)
- Grayscale images: 1 channel

### RGB to Grayscale Conversion
- *Process Name*: Color Space Conversion
- Reduces 3-channel RGB image to single-channel grayscale
- Memory efficiency: 66% reduction in storage space
- Maintains essential visual information while simplifying processing

### Applications
- Computer vision preprocessing
- Memory optimization for large datasets
- Feature extraction simplification
- Machine learning model input preparation
